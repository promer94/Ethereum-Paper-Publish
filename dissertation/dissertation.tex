\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Project aim}
Digitization and Web technologies are now changing the way of publishing and disseminating the knowledge.
It becomes more convenient and less expensive for people to access the knowledge. 
The knowledge creation process is more dynamic right now. 
Text/graphics/rich media can be changed quickly and easily while at the same time being available to all the audiences.
However, most of current methods of academic publication are static, that means, they cannot be revised over time\cite{heller2014dynamic}. 
Web technologies actually have the power to make it more dynamic but is currently underused. On the other hands, journals, publishers and funders control
the entire process of academic publishing. The view of authors who should also participate in the publishing process tends to be underrepresented. 
Despite that fact that the current academic publishing system is advance and productive, 
authors still want a more open and decentralize publishing process \cite{d2018authors}.
The aim of this project is trying to provide a prototype decentralize application 
to help authors to manage their publish and their attribution agreements in a trusted way.
